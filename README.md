# Amazon-Clone
This is a simple Amazon Clone built using HTML and CSS to replicate the look and feel of the Amazon homepage. It is a frontend-only project that focuses on layout, styling, and responsiveness.
I have also included the images that I have used in this project to give a real touch like Amazon.
